# FracNut_GUI Readme.md

Here is the Readme file of Project FracNut_GUI.

Now the current version is GUI Developer Beta 1.0.0, the textbox in program is unable to accept keyboard input and the window may show unknown bugs.

I'm currently doing maintenance on that.

## The main features of the program
FracNut (derived from FractionUtility) is a calculator focuses on fraction calculation. You'll use [a/b] to express a fraction a/b. And the program will return a value in fraction.

For example, if you input 2.2-[11/5] in program, the program will be returning 0; if you input 1/3+[1/4] in program, the program will be returning 7/12.
